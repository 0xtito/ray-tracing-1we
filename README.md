# Ray Tracing in One Weekend (not really tho)

Implementing the ray tracer found [here](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html). I'm doing it in Zig cause im on a zig kick and it may be the language of the Gods. C++ is pretty terrible to code with too ngl.

I will be slowly adding to this as I have time, but one weekend I may actually just commit and finish it all.
